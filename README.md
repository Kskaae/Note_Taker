# Kskaae Note_Taker

Simple overview of use/purpose.
My goals included: 
Creating an application that can be used to write, save, and delete notes. 
This application will use an express backend and a save and 
retrieve note data from a JSON file.


## Description
*[GitHub](https://github.com/Kskaae/Note_Taker.)
This project was fun and moderatly difficult. I was able to understand the base requirments however I ran into some trouble with deleting information using app.delete. I definately plan on revisiting this project to make sure it is fully funtional in the future.
